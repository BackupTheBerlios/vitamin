In this directory you find screenshots of Vitamin. The
following screenshots are available:

- GUI.png:
  shows the GUI of the master. Here you can specify which
  protocols you want to visualize, which diagrams you want
  to see, ...

  In the left part of the GUI you can select the diagrams.

  In the right part you see, which slaves are connected
  to the master.

  In the middle part you can specify the filter. You can
  choose the protocols that will be visualized. You can choose
  a color for each protocol. Also you can specify that only 
  traffic over some ports or/and IP addresses will be
  visualized.

  NOTE: you can specify a filter for each diagram. Therefore
  you have to set the filter for a diagram explicitly through
  pressing the "set to diagram" button (please select the
  diagram you want to set the filter for before).


- sequence-diagram.png:
  This is one of the two diagram types that are
  available right now: a typical UML sequence diagram.
  The color of the arrows is the color of the protocol.

- network_topology_diagram.png:
  This is the second of the tow diagram types that are
  available right now: a map of the network topology.
  This diagram is good for visualizing streams (e.g. RTP).
  If a stream is detected from node A to node B the
  connection between these nodes will be painted in the
  color of the protocol.
