history of Vitamin

- it works, but there is a lot of work to do ...


1.1beta
- Slaves do now send a timestamp of captured packets to the master.
  Due to that diagrams can now work with this new information. Sequence
  diagrams now have the possibility to use this information.
  NOTE: Vitamin does not handle clock synchronization. If the clocks of
  the slaves and the master are not synchronized (e.g. through NTP) using
  the timestamp information will cause wrong visualization!

- Slaves do now react to signal messages after starting viualization.
  This means you can now press the STOP button and the slaves
  will stop (yeah, really!).
  
- You can stop the visualization now by closing the diagram window (by
  clicking the x). This has the same effect as pressing STOP.
  
- The sequence diagram now has a "reset" button.

- several bugs fixed
